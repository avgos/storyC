An insane Russian scientist plans to annihilate mankind by assassinating 
the only Chinese leader who believes in peace. Bond encounters 
his nemesis and they exchange veiled threats. Predictably, Bond 
meets a ravishing mistress of the Bad Guy (TM), whom he seduces. 
Soon after, Bond is seized by commandos and tied under a submarine. 
After some spectacular violence, he escapes by using his ballpoint 
pen grenade. Finally, with only minutes to spare, Bond restores 
internet service to the world and returns to England.
